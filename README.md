## 1. Description

Application to see a Movie Cathalogue designed for a spepcific group of users interested in a movie theme.

with an URL.

## 4. Technical Requeriments /

- Individual Programming
- Create a new repository from the starting using npm init.

- Install a testing framework.
- Install dependencies with ` npm install `
- Plan and execute Unit Testing
- Run Unit testing with ` npm test `

- Set a .gitignore file to avoid the node_modules to be uploaded in GitHub.
- Create the Release branch (to deliver and deploy) and the Development branch (to work on it daily).
- Make a full responsive website consider at least 2 types of dispositives, cellphone and desktop.
- Follow up Semantic HTML rules, have header, navigation bar, main, sections, asides, footer, etc.
- If required, create an Assets folder.
- Document every Agile SDLC steps on ReadMe.md. During the planning step document a screenshot of your Backlog.
- Use the API of [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) (The Open Movie Database). 
- Use Bootstrap Framework to speed your UI coding.
- Two sprints of 1 week each one, and 2 5m Demos on each Friday by 8:00 am.
- For the last daily plan to have a bilingual speech ready.

The _boilerplate_ should contains a file structure as a starting point like thisas all the sample dependencies and tests configuration:

```text
./
├── .editorconfig
├── .eslintrc
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── data.js
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── index.js
│   └── style.css
└── test
    ├── app.spec.js
    ├── headless.js
    └── index.html
```

### Scripts / Files

* `README.md`: should explain how to download, install and run the application
  as well as an introduction to the application, its functionality and decisions about
  design they took.
* `src / index.html`: this is the entry point to your application. This file
  it must contain to _markup_ (HTML) and include the necessary CSS and JavaScript.
* `src / app.js`: here you must implement the web application main functionality to manipulate the data coming from data.js
* `src / data.js`: here you must get the data from the API and then export it to be used in the app.js module.
* `src / index.js`: here you must listen to DOM events, like create and add events to the DOM and get the search values to be processed to app.js
* `test / app.spec.js`: this file contains some sample tests and here you will have to implement the tests.

**CLUES:**

These are some tips that can help you in organizing and carrying out your project, taking into account the development of your _soft skills_:

* To start an organization of your project, see with what resources
  accounts and the time you have to complete it.
* If there is something that you do not know, ask and try to solve it; you can start with
  a google search, then consulting your squad and finally your coach. 
  If there is something that I do not know, someone else can help me. Learning is a
  collaborative process.
* Once you start to move forward ask for feedback, your colleagues may have
  excellent ideas or ways to solve the project that can help you.
* When you run into a problem, look for alternatives, and for that, consult
  different sources.
* If you already see yourself investing a lot of time in details, you should know how to prioritize and
  stick with the most important, projects have limited time and you must
  know how to manage it.
* Work as a team, ask questions and try to complete the project without giving up.
* Prepare your presentation, if I cannot communicate my ideas to others I do not know
  You will appreciate all the effort and work you put into it.

## 5. Hacker Edition

---

You are not limited to implementing only the mandatory part. You can add also other nice to have functionalities on this web application, like a authentication login, 
a favourites list creation using and array and storing for now, in `localStorage`browser object.
